# Hopinion
Hopinion is a fully responsive full-stack user based app that allows users to search cities and write comments about different
beers they have tried.

## Introduction
Often times people travel out of town or state and want to enjoy what the local area has to offer. Beer is no exception to 
this, so that's where Hopinion comes in. Hopinion allows for users to search a city and get detailed information on breweries 
and beers in the area. It also allows for users to leave feedback including rating and thoughts on beers.

## How it Works
### Search by City
Use the search bar to search any city and browse the map or list of breweries. Get a full list of beers that the brewery
has to offer or get detailed information on a individual beer by clicking on the beer cards.

### Add Hopinions
After you have tried a beer, leave your thoughts and rating of the beer to add to the "My Hopinions" page that lets you
revisit previous comments and ratings of all beers you have tried.
